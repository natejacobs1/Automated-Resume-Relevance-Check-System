Automated Resume Relevance Check System is a Python-based tool that automatically evaluates resumes against job descriptions to generate a relevance score. It parses and cleans the input files (PDF/DOCX/TXT), extracts key skills and experience, and uses NLP techniques to compare them with job requirements. The system helps recruiters and applicants quickly assess how well a resume matches a role, saving time and ensuring more consistent screening.
